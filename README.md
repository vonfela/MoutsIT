  Cypress Automation e2e Testing Project with JavaScript
</h1>







## 📝 Brief Description

This project implements automated testing for ServeRest (https://serverest.dev), a REST API simulator for testing and learning. The test suite includes both UI and API tests, focusing on user authentication, registration, and management functionalities. Built with Cypress, the project follows best practices such as Page Object Model, custom commands, and parallel test execution.

### Key Features at a Glance:
- 🌐 Complete UI test coverage for user flows
- 🔑 API integration tests
- 📊 Automated test reports
- 📹 Video recording of test executions
- 📸 Automatic screenshots on test failures
- ⚡ Parallel test execution support
- 🎯 Custom commands for common operations



This project contains automated tests for both UI and API testing using Cypress. It includes tests for user registration, login, and API endpoints validation.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Test User Requirements

Before running the tests, ensure that the test user exists in the application. The application database is periodically cleaned, which might delete the test user.

1. Test User Credentials (must exist in the application):
Email: `Cypress.env('EMAIL')`
Password: `Cypress.env('PASSWORD')`

2. If the user doesn't exist, create it manually through:
   - Access: https://front.serverest.dev/login
   - Click on "Cadastre-se"
   - Register with the credentials above
   - Make sure to check "Cadastrar como administrador"

### Why is this important?
- The application (ServeRest) performs periodic database cleanup
- Test user might be deleted during this cleanup
- Tests will fail if the user doesn't exist
- All tests depend on successful authentication

### Handling User Deletion
If tests start failing with authentication errors:
1. Check if the test user still exists
2. If not, recreate the user with the exact credentials
3. Update the token in `cypress.env.json` if necessary
